## What It Does

ToolNeuron runs AI models directly on your Android device. Import any GGUF model (Llama, Mistral, Gemma) or Stable Diffusion 1.5 model and start generating text or images completely offline.

**Core Features:**
- Run any GGUF format language model locally
- Generate images with Stable Diffusion 1.5 (censored or uncensored)
- Encrypted local storage for conversations and generated content
- Custom model configurations and sampling parameters
- Complete offline operation with zero data transmission

**Privacy Architecture:**
- All processing occurs on-device
- AES-256-GCM encryption for stored data
- No telemetry, no logging, no cloud dependencies
- Open source for full transparency

2. Open ToolNeuron and navigate to model selection
3. Import your downloaded GGUF file
4. Wait for model to load, then start chatting

### Image Generation

1. Download Stable Diffusion 1.5 model (ONNX format)
   - Censored or uncensored variants available
   - Model size: ~2GB

2. Navigate to image generation settings
3. Import your SD model
4. Enter prompt and generate (30-90 seconds depending on device)

### Model Sources

- [Hugging Face GGUF Models](https://huggingface.co/models?other=gguf)
- [Hugging Face Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/models?other=stable-diffusion)
- Community-shared models via Discord

## Technical Details

### Architecture

**Language:** Kotlin + C++ (JNI bindings)  
**UI Framework:** Jetpack Compose  
**Text Inference:** llama.cpp (GGUF support)  
**Image Inference:** Stable Diffusion 1.5 C++ implementation  
**Storage:** Room (SQLite) + AES-256-GCM encryption  
**Async:** Kotlin Coroutines + Flow  

### Memory Management

- Efficient context caching for faster inference
- Memory-mapped model loading
- Automatic RAM optimization based on device capabilities
- Background processing with WorkManager

### Storage System

- Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) for crash recovery
- LZ4 compression for efficient storage
- Content deduplication via SHA-256 hashing
- Encrypted block storage with hardware-backed keys

---

## System Performance

**Text Generation (7B GGUF Q4):**
- 6GB RAM: 2-4 tokens/sec
- 8GB RAM: 4-8 tokens/sec
- 12GB RAM: 8-15 tokens/sec

**Image Generation (SD 1.5):**
- Mid-range (SD 8 Gen 1): 60-90 seconds
- Flagship (SD 8 Gen 3): 30-50 seconds

Performance varies based on model size, quantization, and device hardware.

## FAQ

**Q: Does this work offline?**  
A: Yes. All AI processing happens on your device with zero internet requirement.

**Q: How much storage do I need?**  
A: Depends on models you use. Budget 5-8GB for typical setup (one 7B GGUF + SD 1.5).

**Q: Will this drain my battery?**  
A: Local AI is power-intensive. Keep device charged during long sessions.

**Q: Is my data private?**  
A: Yes. Nothing leaves your device. Verify in the open-source code.

**Q: Can I use my own models?**  
A: Yes. Any GGUF format model or SD 1.5 checkpoint works.

**Q: Why is image generation slow?**  
A: SD 1.5 is computationally expensive. 30-90 seconds is normal on mobile hardware.
