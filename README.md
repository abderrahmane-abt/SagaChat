## Overview

ToolNeuron is an open-source Android application that delivers enterprise-grade AI capabilities to smartphones through a hybrid architecture prioritizing user control and data sovereignty.

### Core Philosophy

Traditional mobile AI applications force users to choose between two unsatisfactory options: limited offline functionality or cloud-dependent platforms that compromise privacy. ToolNeuron resolves this false dichotomy.

**Three Operating Modes:**

- **Privacy Mode** — Execute quantized GGUF models entirely on-device using `llama.cpp`. Your data never leaves your phone.
- **Power Mode** — Connect to 100+ premium models (GPT-4, Claude 3.5, Llama 3, Gemini) via OpenRouter for complex tasks.
- **Hybrid Intelligence** — Seamlessly switch between modes mid-conversation while preserving full context.

---

## Key Features

### Dual Inference Engine

**Local Execution**  
Native support for GGUF model formats with zero-latency inference. All processing occurs on-device with no network dependencies.

**Cloud Orchestration**  
Unified API integration through OpenRouter provides access to 100+ state-of-the-art models without vendor lock-in.

**Intelligent Streaming**  
Real-time token generation with context-aware memory management ensures smooth performance across both local and cloud deployments.

### Premium Offline Text-to-Speech

Powered by Sherpa-ONNX, ToolNeuron includes 11 professional-grade voices (5 American Female, 2 American Male, 2 British Female, 2 British Male) that run entirely on CPU/NPU with zero cloud dependencies and near-instantaneous synthesis.

### Extensible Plugin System

**Available Now:**
- Web Search — Real-time information retrieval
- Web Scraper — Extract and inject context from any URL
- DataHub — Mount JSON/text datasets to dynamically enhance model knowledge

**In Development:**
- Code execution environments
- Image processing pipelines
- Document analysis tools

### Advanced Context Management

- **Conversation Persistence** — Full chat history retention with efficient storage
- **Dynamic Datasets** — Attach custom knowledge bases without model retraining
- **Context Preservation** — Switch models mid-conversation without losing thread continuity
